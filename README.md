BGPSecX is an SDN-based architecture to make origin authetication and path validation to enhance BGP security, and have as targets the Internet Exchange Points (IXP). Includes secure communication channels between IXPs to enable collaboration. SDN shifts the computational burden from routers to the logically-centralised controller, while enabling BGP not to be changed. Targeting IXPs and promoting inter-IXP collaboration enables hard-to-obtain security guarantees (such as path validation) and the creation of incentives to foster adoption of BGP security services. To ensure several security aspects, It uses blockchain as main database.
